# Code hiding in master branch

I am not actively working on this project, and Angular has TONS of dependencies
that keep triggering github's dependabot to bug me about updating dependencies.

All the code is still in the master branch, but I'm creating this blank main
branch and making it defaul to hopefully give my inbox a break.
